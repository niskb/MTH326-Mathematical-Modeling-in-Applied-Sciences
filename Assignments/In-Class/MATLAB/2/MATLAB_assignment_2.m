% MATLAB assignment 2
% A free fall ball dropped from a 400-ft height cliff. Without 
% considering the air resistance force, (a) plot the trajectory of the ball
% for the time period 0<=t<=50 (sec) where the function s(t) represents 
% the height of the ball above the ground. (b) Generate velocity v.s. time
% plot. (c) Consider the case when the initial velocity is 2 ft/sec, how
% does the trajectory look like?

% s(t) = -4.9*t^2;
% v(t) = -9.8*t;
% a(t) = -9.8;
